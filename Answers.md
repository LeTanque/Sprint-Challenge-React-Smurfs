- [ ] Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

  - server routing is where user routing is handled at the server level. Links resolve to pages which are all loaded individually. Client routing is the modern approach to routing that frameworks such as React use to route users through components. Load parts of page within UI, not entire page. 

- [ ] Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

  - C=create POST; R=read GET; U=update PUT/PATCH; D=destroy DELETE

- [ ] Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.

  - Axios; FetchAPI; jQuery
